# Eco_Friendly_Smart_Office_Raspi
This project is Made to reduce Electricity usage by closing ports when they are not being used outside of working hours, and they turn back on automatically when they sense movement for 5 minutes and then turn back off if they don't sense any


I used POE(Power Over Ethernet) to power the Raspberry Pi (Raspberry Pi 3 B+) and then used a PIR (Passive Infra-red) Sensor to Check for movements. Then I made a GitHub Repository where I would be Uploading all my code, I then Downloaded Raspberry pi Lite onto the Raspberry Pi and got it connected to the network, I then asked it to generate me a Key, Which I used to connect it to GitHub. I then used SSH(Secure Shell) to send my code encrypted(to keep us safe), to get everything set up, updated and working.

The project will require python 3.12.3, Raspberry Pi 3 B+, Visual Studio Code, Required to download Requirements.twt (pip install -r Requirements.txt)
